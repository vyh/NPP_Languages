# NPP Languages 

Currently contains a single user-defined language, for a simple assembly language corresponding to the theoretical LC4 ISA used in CS courses at the University of Pennsylvania. Font colors chosen to work with a dark background.

If you have an older version of Notepad++ (< 6.2), use LC4.xml; it may also work in version 6.2, but the language file format was updated with that release, and I don't know about the backwards compatibility. The format was updated again with version 6.3, and there is an updated LC4 file for that format (LC4-udl2_1.xml).

## Installing

    1. Go to View > User-Defined Dialogue... (or Language > Define your language...)
    2. Click Import...
    3. Select the language xml file to import and click Open
    4. Restart Notepad++
    
The new language should appear in the Language menu, toward the bottom near User-Defined.
